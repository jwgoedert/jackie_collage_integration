## Setup

There are several main files on this working branch, the gptlayout.js is the current working file for the vine line. The others have elements that may or may not be added back in at a later date. 

To open the site make sure you have liveserver installed in VSCode or another means of serving the index.html file.

Open the index.html using liveserver and the collages should appear with svg paths connecting them. 

As of January 9th, this is still very much in process and need of refinement so take all displayed info and graphics with a grain of salt...
