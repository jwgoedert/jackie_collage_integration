          Jackie Sumell (born 1973) is an American multidisciplinary artist and activist whose work interrogates the abuses of the American criminal justice system. She is best known for her collaborative project with the late Herman Wallace, one of the former Angola 3 prisoners, entitled <em>The House That Herman Built</em>. This project is the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary film aired on PBS entitled <em>Herman's House</em>.

        <p><strong>Early Life</strong></p>
        <p>
          Sumell was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island, New York. She was the first girl to play competitive tackle football in an all-boys league in New York. She graduated from Connetquot High School and went on to the College of Charleston, where she played Division I soccer. During her undergraduate studies, Sumell spent a year abroad studying at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia (1995).
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Education</strong></p>
        <p>
          Sumell received a Bachelor of Science from the College of Charleston in 1996. She earned a Post-Baccalaureate degree from the San Francisco Art Institute (2001) and a Master of Fine Arts in New Practices from Stanford University (2004).
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Early Work</strong></p>
        <p>
          While working on her M.F.A. at Stanford, Sumell challenged President George Bush's election and his policies toward women through a project entitled <em>No Bush</em>. Sumell asked women to shave their pubic hair and send it to her in a plastic bag, which she exhibited on a clothesline at the National Mall to draw attention to the erosion of pro-choice laws under the Bush administration. While in residency at the Temple Bar Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, Sumell explored locality, difference, and identity in a project called <em>A=AGHT</em>. It connected youth from New Orleans to youth from Dublin through their joint creation of an imaginary city.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>The House That Herman Built</strong></p>
        <p>
          In 2001, Sumell attended a lecture in San Francisco where she met Robert King, the first of the Angola 3 to be released from prison and decades of solitary confinement at Angola Prison. She was moved by King's composure despite his having spent 29 years in solitary confinement. King suggested she write to his comrades, Albert Woodfox and Herman Wallace. Wallace, imprisoned since 1972, was placed in solitary confinement after being accused of the murder of a prison guard at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. After two years of correspondence with Wallace, Sumell asked him to describe his dream home, which became the basis for their collaborative project, <em>The House That Herman Built</em>. A documentary film, <em>Herman's House</em>, chronicles their collaboration.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The project tours as an art exhibition and serves as a dialogue about the use of long-term solitary confinement in America's prisons. Sumell also aims to construct <em>The House That Herman Built</em> as a community space in Wallace's hometown of New Orleans, intended for youth outreach and education. The exhibition has been shown internationally in venues such as the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, The Brooklyn Library, and ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany. Herman Wallace died in 2013, shortly after being released from prison, but Sumell continues her advocacy against long-term solitary confinement.

        <p><strong>Solitary Gardens</strong></p>
        <p>
          Sumell's <em>Solitary Gardens</em> project protests solitary confinement and uses the tools of prison abolition, permaculture, and alternative education. Six-foot-by-nine-foot garden plots, matching the dimensions of solitary confinement cells, are "gardened" by prisoners through written exchanges with outside volunteers. This project explores the connection between the history of slavery and the modern prison system. Supported by organizations such as the Nathan Cummings Foundation and the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, <em>Solitary Gardens</em> aims to inspire a future without prisons.
